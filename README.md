# NFS Unite Shaders
 Source code for the custom shaders in the Unite mod for NFS Heat.

# Usage
These shaders are meant for use with [3DMigoto]. If you have an existing 3DMigoto installation in your game directory (if you downloaded Unite you'll likely already have one), rename the file names of the shaders from here to the file names located at the top of each file, then place them inside the `ShaderFixes` folder and remove any existing compiled shaders from the `ShaderCache` folder.

# Credits
- Electronic Arts/Ghost Games/Criterion Games for developing and publishing NFS Heat.
- [3DMigoto] devs for making it extremely easy to dump and replace shaders.
- [Baldurk] and any [RenderDoc] contributors for making the shader debugging process pain-free (I know you don't want it being used with retail games but it had to be done lol).
